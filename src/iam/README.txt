The file that is used for this task is "main_task3.ipynb". 
The file uses data (.png and .txt) from the "data" folder. 
"main_task3.ipynb" is used for training (excluding the code that is used for gridsearch, creating graphs etc.) and testing.

"main_task3.ipynb" can be used for testing by typing the following command:

jupyter main_task3.ipynb 
python -m main_task3.ipynb

A path to the test data can be used as an input argument.
Note: if reading the input argument from the command line does not work, the test path can be set manually. 
We specifically included the "UNCOMMENT" part of the code for this.

The requirements for running the file are in "requirements.txt"
